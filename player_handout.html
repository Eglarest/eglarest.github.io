  <h2>
   Gameplay
  </h2>
  <p>
   I am proposing a number of house rules to clarify some areas of the game, and how I will handle them, or additions to make everything a bit more interesting. If people have problems with any, they do not have to be used. I think that they should make everything run a bit smoother or at least very interesting. This is covered in the
   <em>
    house rules
   </em>
   section.
   <strong>
    If you are not interested in game rules specifics, skip to the
    <em>
     Information for Characters
    </em>
    section
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   I have included information as well that covers the handling of the rulebooks, setting, and source material.
  </p>
  <h3>
   House Rules
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ability Score Generation:
    </strong>
    as a group roll
    <em>
     3d6 drop the lowest + 4
    </em>
    ; 5 times. These are shared, and everyone can take 3 of these rolls for their character and place them wherever you want. The remaining scores will be rolled straight down using
    <em>
     3d6 re-rolling any 1s
    </em>
    . This gives a total set of ability scores that is slightly higher than standard and provides better parity for ability scores in the party while allowing individuality.
   </li>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Backgrounds:
     </strong>
     Characters before level 3 are not considered fully formed heroes. At character creation, a background is chosen, but the
     <em>
      Distinctive Quality
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      Specialty
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      Hope
     </em>
     , and
     <em>
      Dispair
     </em>
     are left empty. These attributes are added over your first 2 levels of play, based on how you play your character (Add them at your discretion). If they have not been added they
     <em>
      must
     </em>
     be filled in by the time you go to 3rd level.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Inspiration:
     </strong>
     an inspiration die is a
     <em>
      1d6
     </em>
     (rather than Advantage) and can be added to any
     <em>
      1d20
     </em>
     roll. You can only have 1 inspiration at a time. You can add it after a roll, but before knowing the result. If you already have an Inspiration and get a second inspiration, it is applied immediately to the action you received the inspiration for (if applicable).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Death and Dying:
     </strong>
     If a character drops to 0 or lower
     <em>
      HP
     </em>
     death saves are made in secret between the dying character and the
     <em>
      GM
     </em>
     and should be kept secret from there rest of the party (as well as possible). Coming back from death results in a point of exhaustion. For an
     <strong>
      NPC
     </strong>
     if they drop to 0
     <em>
      HP
     </em>
     they will fall unconscious and die after 3 turns. NPC's can be killed using an
     <em>
      Action
     </em>
     and can be revived in the same way as a PC with either magical healing or a successful DC 10 healing skill check.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Reverse Armor Class (for PCs):
     </strong>
     Instead of the GM rolling to hit, the
     <em>
      PC
     </em>
     roll a * defense
     <em>
      roll, based on their armor class. They have to roll
     </em>
     <em>
      d20 + AC
     </em>
     <em>
      . The DC is
     </em>
     <em>
      20+ the monster’s attack bonus
     </em>
     <em>
      . So the players need to
     </em>
     beat* the monster’s attack threat DC to defend against the attack. If the player rolls a 1, the monster gets a critical hit. if the player rolls a 20 the monster fumbles.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Initiative:
     </strong>
     A critical success on initiative gives the
     <em>
      PC
     </em>
     a surprise round, a critical failure means that the character is
     <strong>
      stunned
     </strong>
     until the start of its turn.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Flanking:
     </strong>
     Flanking an enemy (when an allied character is positioned on the opposite side of an enemy) gives you
     <strong>
      +1d6
     </strong>
     to
     <em>
      Attack
     </em>
     and
     <strong>
      +1d4
     </strong>
     to damage.

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Exploration Turns
     </strong>
     During an exploration phase (outside combat) each player gets a 5-minute turn. Ordered based on Initiative bonus. If a character initiates combat during their turn, everyone behind them in the turn-order still can take a turn.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Armor Size:
     </strong>
     If the value is greater than 80 gp, the
     <em>
      PHB
     </em>
     variant Equipment Sizes rules apply. Armor under 80 gp is considered not crafted to be as form-fitting and will work provided the armor is the same size (small/medium/large) and type (humanoid/giant/etc) as the character. Magic armor over 1000 gp (about) can automatically adjust to fit the wearer (within reason).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Talents:
     </strong>
     At every level, a character can create a special talent. This should be a skill-based ability, that normally would be impractical, but would be
     <em>
      cool
     </em>
     . The ability can be made as a
     <em>
      DC 10
     </em>
     skill check. The goal is a cool talent, not a mechanical benefit,
     <em>
      GM
     </em>
     has the final say. It is recommended that they are based on either memorable actions performed in their adventures, or an ability connected to their background that they have trained during their free time at home. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      An elven bowman that has developed an ability to slide down a surface, like stairs, while still taking a full attack.
     </li>
     <li>
      A Hobbit has great expertise in eating mushrooms, and therefore automatically can determine if a fungus is eatable.
     </li>
     <li>
      A princess unable to be taken seriously as a warrior develops immense skill in disguising herself as a man, allowing her to travel with the army as a great warrior.
     </li>
     <li>
      After fighting a troll a hobbit gets particularly skilled at climbing large creatures, to better be able to attack them. Giving the hobbit an ability to climb up foes at least twice as large as themselves while in combat, though as difficult terrain.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Planning and Engagements:
     </strong>
     To streamline preparation for an adventure or an encounter (such as raiding an orc camp) rather than having to come up with specifics, the planning is done based on the
     <em>
      Blades in the Dark
     </em>
     game system. Letting the actual planning be up the characters, and the players just fill in details.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <em>
       Step 1
      </em>
      type of plan and detail the players provide.
      <ul>
       <li>
        Assault - point of attack
       </li>
       <li>
        Deception - method of deception
       </li>
       <li>
        Stealth - the point of infiltration
       </li>
       <li>
        Occult - the arcane method
       </li>
       <li>
        Social - the social connection
       </li>
       <li>
        Transport - the route and means
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Step 2
      </em>
      the detail: the players fill in the detail, or gather the information that allows them to do that.
     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Step 3
      </em>
      items: the items each character will be bringing is selected (generally their full adventuring pack), most important if the character owns more than a single pack of belongings.
     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Step 4
      </em>
      skill checks. the PCs will enter into the encounter assuming proper planning was made but ignoring the actual outlining of special precautions and such.
      <ul>
       <li>
        example: the group is breaking into a mountain fortress based on a successful knowledge history check know to approach the fortress from the rear as there is a hidden door, giving access to the inner chambers of the mountain.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Step 5
      </em>
      Flashbacks. each PC gets a number of flashbacks equal to their intelligence modifier that allow them to declare an action that took place ahead of time. This cannot undo any event that has already occurred.
      <ul>
       <li>
        example: after a close friend betrays you and imprisons you in his wizard tower, you
        <em>
         flashback
        </em>
        to earlier that week when you had told another friend that if you failed to meet him but midday Sunday, he was to send assistance because something evil had befallen you.
       </li>
       <li>
        example: trying to escape from the cellars of an elvish castle you hear the cellar keeper returning early from the feast. you
        <em>
         flashback
        </em>
        to earlier that day when you slipped a sleeping potion into his personal wineskin. you must succeed in a stealth/sleight of hand skill check and on a success, the cellar keeper falls asleep at the base of the stairs.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Information For Players
  </h3>

   All the

   </strong>

    classes
   </strong>
   in
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   the
   <em>
    Adventures in Middle Earth
   </em>
   books are allowed to play.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, it should be noted that the books are written in the context of adventures taking place in the period between the
   <em>
    Hobbit
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    the Lord of the Rings
   </em>
   (2941-3018) and this adventure will take place over 200 years earlier before the dragon Smaug comes to Erebor. Therefore not all characters, places, and events mentioned in the
   <em>
    AiME
   </em>
   books are relevant. If unsure, check with the
   <em>
    GM
   </em>
   . Generally, the major difference is most characters have not been born yet.
  </p>
  <p>
   As this is set inside an existing story, there is information available about many of the events that occur, have occurred, and will occur. I have chosen a time and place to set this adventure that does not have a lot of content previously written about it. That said, any material written by Tolkien is set in stone, the AiME books are considered guidelines, and we will create the rest of the content as we go. As the GM, I do not want to cause written events to be changed, including if you see me not following the Tolkien content you are free to point it out. Remember, while you may
   <em>
    know
   </em>
   something about the world of middle earth, it doesn't mean your character knows that fact, try your best to keep the knowledge separate.
  </p>
  <p>
   I want to run this game in the same feeling of Tolkien, where characters are
   <em>
    Heros
   </em>
   and can do awesome things worth of Song. However, I am placing this in a setting that is darker than the
   <em>
    Hobbit
   </em>
   or
   <em>
    Lord of the Rings
   </em>
   (more like the
   <em>
    Silmarilion
   </em>
   ), and the
   <em>
    Enemy
   </em>
   /
   <em>
    Shaddow
   </em>
   will not be the greatest threat to the characters.

  <h3>
   Player Knowlege
  </h3>
  <p>
   This campaign's starting location and date will be determined based on the characters that are created. The course of events will take the characters far into the
   <strong>
    Northern Wastes / Forodwaith
   </strong>
   where they will have to deal with surviving in an
   <em>
    Arctic
   </em>
   environment, traveling far away from civilization, and exploring the ruins of lost ages with the potential to find ancient and powerful artifacts and fight ancient and powerful creatures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The characters will not cross the
   <em>
    Grey Mountains
   </em>
   until after they reach level 3. I hope to move all characters to level 5 quickly, though I think it is important to play the first levels so that everyone has the chance to get used to the new rules and develop their characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   While characters will have to make hard choices and travel to lands where Sauron is by no means the greatest peril, it is expected that characters
   <em>
    want
   </em>
   to be a member of the party, and
   <em>
    want
   </em>
   to fight against the
   <em>
    Shadow
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    TLDR:
   </strong>
   Characters are
   <em>
    GOOD
   </em>
   . The environment is
   <em>
    SNOW &amp; ICE
   </em>
   . There may be dragons...
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    The following classes may be very nice to have in the party:
   </em>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Treasure Hunter
   </li>
   <li>
    Wanderer

   <strong>
    THE MOVIES DON'T COUNT
   </strong>
   The LoTR movies did well, but are not always correct. dThe Hobbit movies are trash and it would be best you don't embarrass yourself by suggesting that Legolas had anything to do with the recapture of Erebor, and definitely refrain from even thinking that Azog -- actually, serious note: Azog irl (as opposed to in the movie) was the lord of Moria from sometime after
   <em>
    T.A. 2480
   </em>
   till his death in
   <em>
    T.A. 2799
   </em>
   meaning while he died over 200 years before the events in the Hobbit movie,
   <em>
    [spoilers]
   </em>
   you could conceivably end up fighting him at some point in
   <em>
    your
   </em>
   adventures.
